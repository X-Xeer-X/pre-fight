# pre-fight
TERA-proxy module that equips your secondary brooch, uses it and equips primary brooch back.
* Edited and updated by jenoveil, original source: https://github.com/spaacecats/brooch-swap
 * Added deadly gamble + cdr weap functionality to the script.
 * Allows use of the script for characters with different brooch setups.
 * Brooch swap now functions for RK patch quickcarve brooches (obtained thru upgrading, not crafting)
## Settings
* TRIGGER_ITEM can be set to any consumable item of your choice (default: Minor Replenishment Potable)
* Automatically detects if you are playing warrior, and enables the CDR weapon + deadly gamble script.
## Usage
* TRIGGER_ITEM is any item that can be placed on your skillbar
  * Using the TRIGGER_ITEM will trigger the brooch swap
  * You dont have to have TRIGGER_ITEM in your inventory, placing it on your skillbar is enough

## TODO
* Future updates may include pre-fight steroid skill functionality for other skills (e.x. Reaper's Shadow Reaping, Sorcerer's Mana Boost, Slayer's In Cold Blood)
